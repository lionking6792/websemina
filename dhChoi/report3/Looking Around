    <pre> (1) Open my eyes
now I see you in front of me
did I ever tell you how beautiful you are?

I sing with all my heart
this is one thing that I can do
you give me strength
all day and night
makes me smile again

There's a girl who needs your love
looking around...
spread out what you've got from above
When you feel someone needs your love
looking around, say there's the greatest love above

(2) Open my mind
here I stand in front of you
did I ever tell you how wonderful you are?

I pray with all my heart
this is one thing that I can do
you give me strength
all day and night
makes me smile again

There's a girl who needs your love
looking around...
spread out what you've got from above
When you feel someone needs your love
looking around, say there's the greatest love above<br></pre>
